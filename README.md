Your daily dose of eco-inspiration.

### How does this work?

We take a list of relevant keywords, and search YouTube for the first 20 search results. We filter out videos that are too short or too long to qualify for a "daily dose" of inspiration, and keep these video IDs cached for the site to pick from randomly.

We update this list of videos every week or so, in order to keep the selection fresh.
